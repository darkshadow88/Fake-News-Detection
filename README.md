# Fake-News-Detection
## Fake News Detection | NLP | Python | Final Year Project 
This is my final year project where I used Python and Machine Learning methods to detect fake news.
## Steps to run
  1. Install __Python 3.x [NOTE: 3.x means any version with 3]__
 
  2. Create a Separate Folder
  
  3. Run CMD/PowerShell inside that Folder
  
  4. Run the following command
      
      1. `pip install virualenv`
        (This will install a virual environment for our project.)
       
          __After Instaling__
       
        2. `virualenv my_env`
        (This will intialte the virual environment with my_env name. you can give any name of your choice)
        
        3. `cd my_env`
        (Then go inside the my_env Folder)
        
        4. `Scripts\activate`
        (activate the virualenv)
        
  5. Copy all the codes and the requirements.txt file inside my_env
        
  6. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        (It will install all the dependecies for the project.)
  7. Go to this [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
        and download all the neccesary datasets
        
        (For now you can only Download the tranning.csv file)
  8. Create a Folder datasets inside the same folder(i.e my_env) 
        Copy the datsets inside this.
  9. Run the classsifier files and see the output
